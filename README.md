# Sorting-Restaurants-Cafes


| Veriables     |            | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Web Data      | The points that the restaurants get in the web environment | 
| Dinamic Data  |SES Distribution (Socio-Economic Status) of people coming from outside or close to the restaurant|   
| Static Data   |SES Distribution (Socio-Economic Status) of the people living in the area where the restaurant is located |  


The 3 groups above were scored separately, and then these 3 scores were combined to form a "Final score".
I used "K-means" for clustering.
